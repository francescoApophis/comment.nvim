OVERVIEW                                                       *comment-overview*

Comment.nvim is a very modest and simple plugin for commenting and uncommenting 
code I built mainly for myself. For this reason by default it supports comments 
for:

  - Python 
  - C
  - C++
  - C#
  - Golang
  - Rust
  - Java
  - Javascript 
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Lua
  - Sql

Some of them are languages/tools I'm using or have used, others I plan to maybe 
in the future. So sorry if one some languages are missing.



USAGE                                                             *comment-usage*

You use the SAME key or keys-combination for commenting/uncommenting in both 
Normal mode (edit current line) and Visual/V-Line mode (edit range of selected 
lines). That's it, no other functionality, nothing fancy really. 



CONFIGURATION                                             *comment-configuration*

*** I THINK that at the moment this ONLY works if installed with Lazy.nvim***
because I know nothing about plugin managers work so, I don't know.

To set your personal key:
- In your 'comment.lua' file inside your Neovim's plugin folder (create it if you 
don't have one) past this:

>
  return {
    "francescoApophis/comment.nvim",
    lazy = false,
    config = function()
      require("Comment").setup({
        key = "" -- your new key or keys-combination, it can include <leader> if 
        -- have that set up
      })
    end 

  }
